Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!
This repository showcases examples of SQL I've written, demonstrating my skills in database design, query writing, and data analysis. You'll find a variety of projects and scripts, including complex queries, data manipulation techniques, and database optimization examples.

Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss my work further!
